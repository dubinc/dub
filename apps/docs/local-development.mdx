## Introduction

Dub's codebase is set up in a monorepo (via [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo)) and is fully [open-source on GitHub](https://github.com/dubinc/dub).

Here's the monorepo structure:

```
apps
├── docs
├── web
packages
├── tailwind-config
├── tinybird
├── tsconfig
├── ui
├── utils
```

The `apps` directory contains the code for:

- `web`: The entirety of Dub's application ([app.dub.co](https://app.dub.co)) + our link redirect infrastructure.
- `docs`: Dub's documentation site ([dub.co/docs](https://dub.co/docs)) – including this page you're on right now!

The `packages` directory contains the code for:

- `tailwind-config`: The Tailwind CSS configuration for Dub's web app.
- `tinybird`: Dub's Tinybird configuration.
- `tsconfig`: The TypeScript configuration for Dub's web app.
- `ui`: Dub's UI component library.
- `utils`: A collection of utility functions and constants used across Dub's codebase.

## How `app.dub.co` works

Dub's web app is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

It also utilizes code from the `packages` directory, specifically the `@dub/ui` and `@dub/utils` packages.

All of the code for the web app is located in here: [`main`/apps/web/app/app.dub.co](https://github.com/dubinc/dub/tree/main/apps/web/app/app.dub.co). This is using the Next.js [route group pattern](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups).

There's also the API server, which is located in here: [`main`/apps/web/app/api](https://github.com/dubinc/dub/tree/main/apps/web/app/api)

When you run `pnpm dev` to start the development server, the app will be available at [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888). The reason we use `localhost:8888` and not `app.localhost:8888` is because Google OAuth doesn't allow you to use localhost subdomains.

## How link redirects work on Dub

Link redirects on Dub are powered by [Next.js Middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware).

To handle high traffic, we use Redis to cache every link's metadata when it's first created. This allows us to serve redirects without hitting our MySQL database.

Here's the code that powers link redirects:

- Link redirects: [`main`/apps/web/lib/middleware/link.ts](https://github.com/dubinc/dub/blob/main/apps/web/lib/middleware/link.ts).
- Root domain redirects: [`main`/apps/web/lib/middleware/root.ts](https://github.com/dubinc/dub/blob/main/apps/web/lib/middleware/root.ts).

## Running Dub locally

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- A [Tinybird](https://www.tinybird.co/) account
- An [Upstash](https://upstash.com/) account
- A [Planetscale](https://planetscale.com/) account
- A [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) account (optional)
- A [Resend](https://resend.com/) account (optional)

In the future, we plan to make it easier to self-host Dub.co by making these dependencies optional by swapping them out for native databases (e.g. mysql, redis, clickhouse, [GeoLite2](https://github.com/GitSquared/node-geolite2-redist) etc.)

Also, Docker is currently not supported, but we have a few [open](https://github.com/dubinc/dub/issues/25) [issues](https://github.com/dubinc/dub/issues/378) and [PRs](https://github.com/dubinc/dub/pull/391) for it.

### Step 1: Local setup

First, clone the [Dub repo](https://dub.sh/github)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dubinc/dub.git
```

Run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm i
```

Install Mintlify CLI (for docs server):

```bash
pnpm i -g mintlify
```

Convert the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

You can start filling in the first few environment variables:
```bash
# The domain that your app will be hosted on
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_DOMAIN=http://localhost:8888
# The short domain that your app will be using (could be the same as the above)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_SHORT_DOMAIN=dub.localhost:8888
```

You will fill in the remaining environment variables in the following steps.

### Step 2: Publish Tinybird endpoints

Next, you'll need to publish the Tinybird endpoints:

1. In your [Tinybird](https://tinybird.co/) account, create a new Workspace.
2. Copy your `admin` [Auth Token](https://www.tinybird.co/docs/concepts/auth-tokens.html). Paste this token as the `TINYBIRD_API_KEY` environment variable in your `.env` file.
3. In your cloned Dub repo, navigate to the `packages/tinybird` directory.
4. Install the Tinybird CLI with `pip install tinybird-cli` (requires Python >= 3.8).
5. Run `tb auth` and paste your `admin` Auth Token.
6. Run `tb push` to publish the datasource and endpoints in the `packages/tinybird` directory. You should see the following output (truncated for brevity):

```bash
$ tb push

** Processing ./datasources/click_events.datasource
** Processing ./endpoints/clicks.pipe
...
** Building dependencies
** Running 'click_events'
** 'click_events' created
** Running 'device'
** => Test endpoint at https://api.us-east.tinybird.co/v0/pipes/device.json
** Token device_endpoint_read_8888 not found, creating one
** => Test endpoint with:
** $ curl https://api.us-east.tinybird.co/v0/pipes/device.json?token=p.ey...NWeaoTLM
** 'device' created
...
```

### Step 3: Set up Upstash Redis database

Next, you'll need to set up the Upstash Redis database:

1. In your [Upstash account](https://console.upstash.com/), create a new database.
2. For better performance & read times, we recommend setting up a global database with several read regions.

![Upstash Redis database](/images/upstash-create-db.png)

3. Once your database is created, copy the `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` from the **REST API** section into your `.env` file.

![Upstash Redis tokens](/images/upstash-redis-tokens.png)

4. Navigate to the [QStash tab](https://console.upstash.com/qstash) and copy the `QSTASH_URL`, `QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY`, and `QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY` from the **Request Builder** section into your `.env` file.

![Upstash QStash tokens](/images/upstash-qstash-tokens.png)

### Step 4: Set up Planetscale database

In your [Planetscale account](https://app.planetscale.com/), create a new database. You can use the free tier for this project.

Once your database is created, you'll be prompted to select your language or Framework. Select **Prisma**.

![Planetscale choose framework](/images/planetscale-choose-framework.png)

Then, you'll have to create a new password for your database. Once the password is created, scroll down to the **Add credentials to .env** section and copy the `DATABASE_URL` into your `.env` file.

![Planetscale add credentials](/images/planetscale-add-credentials.png)

Going back to your terminal, navigate to the `apps/web` directory and run the following command to generate the Prisma client:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

Then, create the database tables with the following command:

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

### Step 5: Set up Resend (optional)

Next, you'll need to set up Resend for transactional emails (e.g. magic link emails):

1. In your [Resend account](https://resend.com/overview), create a new API key.

![Resend API key](/images/resend-api-key.png)

2. Copy the API key into your `.env` file as the `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable.
3. You'll then need to set up MX records for your domain to start working. You can follow this guide to learn [how to set up MX records with Resend](https://resend.com/docs/dashboard/domains/introduction).

### Step 6: Set up Cloudinary & Unsplash (optional)

If you want to enable the [Custom Social Media Cards](https://dub.co/help/article/how-to-create-link#custom-social-media-cards) feature, you'll need to set up Cloudinary and Unsplash:

- [How to set up `CLOUDINARY_URL` env var](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/node_quickstart#set_your_api_environment_variable)
- [How to set up `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY` env var](https://unsplash.com/documentation#creating-a-developer-account)

### Step 7: Start the development server

Finally, you can start the development server. This will build the packages + start the app servers.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The Web app will be available at [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) and the Docs will be available at [http://localhost:3334](http://localhost:3334).
