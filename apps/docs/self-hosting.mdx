You can self-host Dub.co on your own servers and cloud infrastructure for greater control over your data and design. This guide will walk you through the entire process of setting up Dub.co on your own servers.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
- A [Tinybird](https://www.tinybird.co/) account
- An [Upstash](https://upstash.com/) account
- A [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) account
- A [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) account
- Either a [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) or [AWS](https://aws.com) account

You'll also need a custom domain that you will be using for your Dub.co instance, with an optional custom short domain for your links.

In this guide, we'll use `acme.com` as a placeholder for your custom domain, and `ac.me` as a placeholder for your custom short domain.

## Step 1: Local setup

First, you'll need to clone the Dub.co repo and install the dependencies.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Clone the repo">

First, clone the [Dub repo](https://d.to/github) into a public GitHub repository. If you are planning to distribute the code, make sure to keep the source code public to comply with our [AGPLv3 license](https://d.to/license).

    ```bash Terminal Terminal
    git clone https://github.com/dubinc/dub.git
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Install dependencies">

    Run the following command to install the dependencies:

    ```bash Terminal
    pnpm i
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Remove unnecessary files">

    Delete the `apps/docs` directory since it's not needed for self-hosting:

    ```bash Terminal
    rm -rf apps/docs
    ```

    Delete the `apps/web/vercel.json` file since cron jobs are not required for the self-hosted version:

    ```bash Terminal
    rm apps/web/vercel.json
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up environment variables">

    Convert the `.env.example` file to `.env`. You can start filling in the first few environment variables:

    ```bash Terminal
    # The domain that your app will be hosted on
    NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_DOMAIN=acme.com
    # The short domain that your app will be using (could be the same as the above)
    NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_SHORT_DOMAIN=ac.me
    # The ID of the Vercel team that your app will be deployed to: https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/create-a-team#find-your-team-id
    TEAM_ID_VERCEL=
    # The unique access token for your Vercel account: https://vercel.com/guides/how-do-i-use-a-vercel-api-access-token
    AUTH_BEARER_TOKEN=
    ```

    You will fill in the remaining environment variables in the following steps.

  </Step>

</Steps>

## Step 2: Set up Tinybird Clickhouse database

Next, you'll need to set up the [Tinybird](https://tinybird.co) Clickhouse database. This will be used to store time-series click events data.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Create Tinybird Workspace">

    In your [Tinybird](https://tinybird.co/) account, create a new Workspace.

    Copy your `admin` [Auth Token](https://www.tinybird.co/docs/concepts/auth-tokens.html). Paste this token as the `TINYBIRD_API_KEY` environment variable in your `.env` file.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Install Tinybird CLI and authenticate">

In your newly-cloned Dub.co repo, navigate to the `packages/tinybird` directory.

    Install the Tinybird CLI with `pip install tinybird-cli` (requires Python >= 3.8).

    Run `tb auth` and paste your `admin` Auth Token.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish Tinybird datasource and endpoints">

    Run `tb push` to publish the datasource and endpoints in the `packages/tinybird` directory. You should see the following output (truncated for brevity):

    ```bash Terminal
    $ tb push

    ** Processing ./datasources/click_events.datasource
    ** Processing ./endpoints/clicks.pipe
    ...
    ** Building dependencies
    ** Running 'click_events'
    ** 'click_events' created
    ** Running 'device'
    ** => Test endpoint at https://api.us-east.tinybird.co/v0/pipes/device.json
    ** Token device_endpoint_read_8888 not found, creating one
    ** => Test endpoint with:
    ** $ curl https://api.us-east.tinybird.co/v0/pipes/device.json?token=p.ey...NWeaoTLM
    ** 'device' created
    ...
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up Tinybird API base URL">

    You will then need to update your [Tinybird API base URL](https://www.tinybird.co/docs/api-reference/api-reference.html#regions-and-endpoints) to match the region of your database.

    From the previous step, take note of the **Test endpoint** URL. It should look something like this:

    ```bash Terminal
    Test endpoint at https://api.us-east.tinybird.co/v0/pipes/device.json
    ```

    Copy the base URL and paste it as the `TINYBIRD_API_URL` environment variable in your `.env` file.

    ```bash Terminal
    TINYBIRD_API_URL=https://api.us-east.tinybird.co
    ```

  </Step>
  
</Steps>

## Step 3: Set up Upstash Redis database

Next, you'll need to set up the [Upstash](https://upstash.com) Redis database. This will be used to cache link metadata and serve link redirects.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Create Upstash database">

In your [Upstash account](https://console.upstash.com/), create a new database.

For better performance & read times, we recommend setting up a global database with several read regions.

<Frame>![Upstash Redis database](/images/upstash-create-db.png)</Frame>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up Upstash environment variables">

Once your database is created, copy the `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` from the **REST API** section into your `.env` file.

<Frame>![Upstash Redis tokens](/images/upstash-redis-tokens.png)</Frame>

Navigate to the [QStash tab](https://console.upstash.com/qstash) and copy the `QSTASH_TOKEN`, `QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY`, and `QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY` from the **Request Builder** section into your `.env` file.

<Frame>
![Upstash QStash tokens](/images/upstash-qstash-tokens.png)
</Frame>
  </Step>

</Steps>

## Step 4: Set up PlanetScale MySQL database

Next, you'll need to set up a [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/)-compatible MySQL database. This will be used to store user data and link metadata.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Note>
  PlanetScale recently [removed their free
  tier](https://planetscale.com/blog/planetscale-forever), so you'll need to pay
  for this option. A cheaper alternative is to use a [MySQL database on
  Railway](https://railway.app/template/mysql) ($5/month).
  
  For [local development](local-development), we recommend using a [local MySQL database
  with PlanetScale simulator](local-development#option-1-local-mysql-database-with-planetscale-simulator-recommended) (100% free).
</Note>

<Steps>

  <Step title="Create PlanetScale database">

    In your [PlanetScale account](https://app.planetscale.com/), create a new database.

    Once your database is created, you'll be prompted to select your language or Framework. Select **Prisma**.

    <Frame>
      ![PlanetScale choose framework](/images/planetscale-choose-framework.png)
    </Frame>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up PlanetScale environment variables">

    Then, you'll have to create a new password for your database. Once the password is created, scroll down to the **Add credentials to .env** section and copy the `DATABASE_URL` into your `.env` file.

    <Frame>
    ![PlanetScale add credentials](/images/planetscale-add-credentials.png)
    </Frame>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate Prisma client and create database tables">

In your Dub.co codebase, navigate to `apps/web/prisma/schema.prisma` and replace all the columns in the `DefaultDomains` model to the normalized version of your custom short domain (removing the `.` character).

For example, if your custom short domain is `ac.me`, your `DefaultDomains` model should look like this:

    ```prisma apps/web/prisma/schema.prisma
    model DefaultDomains {
      id          String   @id @default(cuid())
      acme        Boolean  @default(true)
      projectId   String   @unique
      project     Project  @relation(fields: [projectId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
    }
    ```

    In the terminal, navigate to the `apps/web` directory and run the following command to generate the Prisma client:

    ```bash Terminal
    npx prisma generate
    ```

    Then, create the database tables with the following command:

    ```bash Terminal
    npx prisma db push
    ```

  </Step>

</Steps>

## Step 5: Set up GitHub OAuth

Next, [create a new GitHub App](https://github.com/settings/applications/new). This will allow you to sign in to Dub.co with your GitHub account.

Don't forget to set the following Callback URLs:

- `https://app.acme.com/api/auth/callback/github`
- `http://localhost:8888/api/auth/callback/github` for local development.

<Info>
  Optional: Set the "Email addresses" account permission to **read-only** in
  order to access private email addresses on GitHub.
</Info>

Once your GitHub App is created, copy the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` into your `.env` file as the `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables.

## Step 6: Set up Cloudflare R2

Dub stores user-generated assets in either S3 or S3-compatible services like [Cloudflare R2](https://cloudflare.com/r2). These include:

- Project logos
- User avatars
- [Custom Social Media Cards](https://dub.co/help/article/custom-social-media-cards) images

We recommend using [Cloudflare R2](https://cloudflare.com/r2) for self-hosting Dub.co, as it's a more cost-effective solution compared to AWS S3. Here's how you can set it up:

<Steps>

  <Step title="Create R2 bucket">

<Note>You'll need to subscribe to the R2 service if you haven't already.</Note>

In your [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), create a new R2 bucket. We recommend giving your bucket a descriptive name (e.g. `dubassets`) and leaving the remaining settings as is.

<Frame>![Cloudflare R2 bucket](/images/cloudflare-r2-create-bucket.png)</Frame>

In your bucket settings, copy the **S3 API** value – you'll need it in Step 3.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up access to R2">

From the R2 main page, click **Manage R2 API Tokens** on the right-hand column.

<Frame>
  ![Cloudflare manage API tokens](/images/cloudflare-r2-manage-api-tokens.png)
</Frame>

Then, click **Create API Token**.

<Frame>
  ![Cloudflare R2 API token](/images/cloudflare-r2-create-api-token.png)
</Frame>

Make sure to name your API token something relevant to the service that will be using the token.

Give it "Object Read & Write" permissions, and we recommend only applying ito to a single bucket.

You can leave the remaining settings (TTL, Client IP Address Filtering) as is, and click **Create API Token**.

After you create you token, copy the `Access Key ID` and `Secret Access Key` values – you'll need them in the next step.

  </Step>

<Step title="Set up R2 environment variables">

Once you have your credentials, set them in your `.env` file:

```TypeScript .env
STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID= // this is the Access Key ID value from Step 2
STORAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY= // this is the Secret Access Key value from Step 2
STORAGE_ENDPOINT= // this is the S3 API value from Step 1
```

</Step>

<Step title="Set up R2 domain">

In order for your images to be publically accessible in R2 you need to setup a domain. You can either use your own domain or an R2.dev subdomain.

To use your own domain, you'll need to create a CNAME record in your DNS settings that points to your R2 bucket.

In you plan to use an R2.dev subdomain, make sure you "Allow Access".

Then set the `STORAGE_BASE_URL` in your `.env` file to the domain you chose.

```bash
STORAGE_BASE_URL={URL your assets as available at} # https://static.example.com
```

<Frame>![Cloudflare R2 domain](/images/cloudflare-r2-public-domain.png)</Frame>

</Step>

</Steps>

## Step 7: Set up Postmark (optional)

<Note>
  Note that if you want to use magic link sign-in, this is a required step.
</Note>

Next, you'll need to set up Postmark for transactional emails (e.g. magic link emails):

1. Follow [this guide](https://postmarkapp.com/support/article/1008-what-are-the-account-and-server-api-tokens) to create a new API token.
2. Copy the API key into your `.env` file as the `POSTMARK_API_KEY` environment variable.
3. You'll then need to set up DKIM records and for your domain to start working. You can [follow this guide](https://postmarkapp.com/support/article/1002-getting-started-with-postmark) to learn how to do so.

## Step 8: Set up Unsplash (optional)

Dub uses Unsplash's API for the [Custom Social Media Cards](https://dub.co/help/article/custom-social-media-cards) feature. You'll need to set up an Unsplash application to get an access key.

<Frame>
  ![Custom social media
  cards](https://assets.dub.co/changelog/custom-social-cards.png)
</Frame>

Check out Unsplash's [official documentation](https://unsplash.com/documentation#creating-a-developer-account) to learn how you can set up the `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY` env var.

## Step 9: Deploy to Vercel

Once you've set up all of the above services, you can now deploy your app to Vercel.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Deploy code to GitHub">
    If you haven't already, push up your cloned repository to GitHub by running the following commands:

    ```bash Terminal
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git push origin main
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a new Vercel project">
    In your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/), create a new project. Then, select your GitHub repository and click **Import**.

    Make sure that your **Framework Preset** is set to **Next.js** and the **Root Directory** is set to `apps/web`.

    <Frame>
    ![Vercel Framework Preset and Root Directory](/images/vercel-framework-preset.png)
    </Frame>

    In the **Environment Variables** section, add all of the environment variables from your `.env` file by copying all of them and pasting it into the first input field. A few notes:

    - Remove the `PROJECT_ID_VERCEL` environment variable for now since we will only get the project ID after deploying the project.
    - Replace the `NEXTAUTH_URL` environment variable with the app domain that you will be using (e.g. `https://app.acme.com`).

    Click on **Deploy** to deploy your project.

    <Tip>
      If you get a `No Output Directory called "public" was found after the build
      completed` error, make sure that your [Vercel deployment
      settings](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/configure-a-build) to make sure that they match the following:

    <Frame>
    ![Vercel Deploy settings](/images/vercel-deploy-settings.png)
    </Frame>

    </Tip>

    </Step>

  <Step title="Add required environment variables">

Once the project deploys, retrieve your [Vercel project ID](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/overview#project-id) and add it as the `PROJECT_ID_VERCEL` environment variable – both in your `.env` file and in your newly created Vercel project's settings (under **Settings > Environment Variables**)

Add both the `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_DOMAIN` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_SHORT_DOMAIN` as domains in your Vercel project's settings (under **Settings** > **Domains**). You can follow this guide to learn [how to set up a custom domain on Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/domains/add-a-domain).

  </Step>

  <Step title="Redeploy your Vercel project">
  Go back to the **Deployments** page and redeploy your project. 
  
  Once the deployment is complete, you should be able to visit your app domain (e.g. `https://app.acme.com`) and see the following login page:

<Frame>![Whitelabeled Login](/images/whitelabeled-login.png)</Frame>

</Step>

</Steps>

## Caveats

This guide is meant to be a starting point for self-hosting Dub.co. It currently depends on the following services to work:

- [Tinybird](https://www.tinybird.co/) for the analytics database
- [Upstash](https://upstash.com/) for the Redis database
- [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) for the MySQL database
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for hosting & [Edge Middleware](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-middleware)

In the future, we plan to make it easier to self-host Dub.co by making these dependencies optional by swapping them out for native databases (e.g. mysql, redis, clickhouse, [GeoLite2](https://github.com/GitSquared/node-geolite2-redist) etc.)

Also, Docker is currently not supported, but we have a few [open](https://github.com/dubinc/dub/issues/25) [issues](https://github.com/dubinc/dub/issues/378) and [PRs](https://github.com/dubinc/dub/pull/391) for it.
