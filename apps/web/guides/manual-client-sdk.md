You can add the Dub client-side script to your website same way you would add Google Analytics script or any other JavaScript code – by adding it in the `<head>` section of your HTML file.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
<script 
  defer
  src="https://www.dubcdn.com/analytics/script.js" 
></script>
```
