Previously, having billing on a personal account level was a confusing UX.

- Often times, users would upgrade to Pro on their personal accounts, but the Pro plan only applied to the projects they _owned_, not the ones that they are a member of.
- They also couldn't invite teammates to pay invoices.

Migrating billing to the project-level fixes that. You can now manage your billing settings under Settings > Billing in your Dub project.
