We've added "View All" buttons for the **Locations**, **Devices**, and **Referrer** sections on the Link Stats page.

When clicked, this opens up a modal that lets you explore all data points for a given section via a fuzzy search interface. Here's an [example](https://dub.co/stats/github).

This is helpful for sections like `City` that tend to have a lot of data points. Instead of scrolling through a long list, you can now search for a specific city.
