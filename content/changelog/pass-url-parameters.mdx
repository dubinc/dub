You can now pass URL query parameters (`utm_source`, `ref`, etc.) from your short link to its destination URL.

If there are any duplicate parameters, the parameter in the short link will override its counterpart in the destination URL.

For example:

- [dub.sh/oss](https://dub.sh/oss) redirects to `vercel.com/oss?ref=dub`
- [dub.sh/oss?ref=dub.co](https://dub.sh/oss?ref=dub.co) redirects to `vercel.com/oss?ref=dub.co`
