**Update (July 2, 2023): We are changing the way you create tags on Dub ([changelog](/changelog/new-tag-creation-flow))**.

Introducing Tags – a smarter way to manage your links on Dub.

With tags, you can now:

1. Organize your links by campaigns, clients, or any other categories you can think of.
2. Filter your links by tags and get a shareable link to the filtered results.
3. Easily edit/delete your tags with a Notion-style dropdown interface.

This has been a [highly](https://github.com/steven-tey/dub/issues/101) [requested](https://github.com/steven-tey/dub/issues/124) feature since day one (shoutout to our friends at [Refine](https://refine.dev) as well), and we're excited to finally ship it!

Learn more about how to use tags in this [help article](/help/article/how-to-use-tags).
