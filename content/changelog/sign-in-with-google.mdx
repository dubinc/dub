You can now sign in to your Dub account with Google.

We're also deprecating email sign ups as they have been a constant source of spam and abuse (via phishing links).

If you have an existing Dub account, you will still be able to sign in with email, but we recommend connecting your Google account to enable Google sign in moving forward.

We've also added a "Delete Account" feature to the [settings page](https://app.dub.co/settings). You can now delete your Dub account and all associated data, if that's what you want to do.
