Short.io is a popular URL shortener that lets you create short links, which can be used in your marketing campaigns, social media posts, and more.

## How to migrate from Short.io to Dub

If you're looking to migrate from Short.io to Dub, we've built a custom migration tool that will help you migrate your links in a few simple steps.

## Step 1: Get your Short.io API key

First, log into your Short.io account and navigate to the [Integrations & API](https://app.short.io/settings/integrations/api-key) page.

Click on "Create API Key", which will open up a modal. Leave all the options as default and click "Create".

Copy the created API key. You'll need it in the next step.

## Step 2: Use the Short.io migration tool

If you haven't already, [create a project on Dub](what-is-a-project#how-to-create-a-project).

<Note variant="info">
  **Protip**: Once you create your project, we generally recommend you **_not to
  [configure your domain](how-to-add-custom-domain)_** until you've migrated all
  your links. This will prevent any potential downtime for your links.
</Note>

Then, from your project dashboard, click on the `⌄` button next to the **Create Link** button and select **Import from Short.io**.

/>

You'll be prompted to enter your Short.io API key. Paste the API key you copied in the previous step and click **Confirm API Key**.

Behind the scenes, we'll fetch all your Short.io custom domains and their respective number of links. You'll be presented with a list of domains that we've found.

Select the domains you want to migrate and click **Confirm import**. In just a few seconds, all your links will be migrated to Dub.

Once all your links have been imported, we will send you an email to let you know that the migration is complete.

Once you receive the email, you can [configure your domain](how-to-add-custom-domain#step-2-configure-your-domain) and start using your links!

## Which Short.io link attributes are migrated?

Short.io offers many features for its short links, such as link expiration, password protection, and more.

Here's a list of attributes that are migrated from Short.io to Dub:

1. Destination URL
2. Short link slug
3. Link creation date
4. Link expiration date (if enabled)
5. iOS device Targeting (if enabled)
6. Android device targeting (if enabled)
7. Archived status
8. Link title (as part of Dub's [Custom Social Media cards](how-to-create-link#custom-social-media-cards) feature)

Here are the attributes that are not migrated:

1. Password protection
2. Link tags
3. Link 404 URL
4. Link redirect type (Dub uses 307 redirects for all links)
5. Link cloaking (Dub only offers link cloaking for the root domain of your project)

If there are any attributes that you'd like to see migrated, please [send us an email](mailto:support@dub.co?subject=Short.io%20migration%20feedback) and let us know!
