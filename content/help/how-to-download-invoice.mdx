## Downloading your Dub invoice from Stripe

Since we use [Stripe](https://stripe.com) to process payments, you can download your Dub invoice from Stripe by following the steps below:

1. From your project dashboard (e.g. `app.dub.co/your-project`), click on the **Settings** tab.
2. On the left sidebar, click on **Billing**.
3. Click on the **Manage Subscription** button to go to your Stripe dashboard.
