Dub is the link management tool for modern marketing teams. With Dub, you can create, share, and track short links using your own [custom domain](how-to-add-custom-domain).

<Note variant="info">
  Fun fact: The name **Dub** comes from the literal definition of the word
  **"dub"** – which is to "give an unofficial name or nickname to something" (_a
  là what Dub does with longer URLs_).
