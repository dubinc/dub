Tags are a great way to organize your links on Dub. You can use tags to group links together and make it easier to find them later.

## What is a Tag?

A tag is a label that you can assign to a link. Tags are color-coded and can be created and assigned to a link in just a few clicks.

With tags, you can:

1. Organize your links by campaigns, clients, or any other categories you can think of.
2. Filter your links by tags and get a shareable link to the filtered results.
3. Easily edit/delete your tags with a Notion-style dropdown interface.

## How to create a Tag

To create a tag, you first have to [create a link](how-to-create-link).

In the link creation modal, click on the tag input field and type in the name of the tag you want to create.

If the tag already exists, you can select it from the dropdown. Otherwise, press `Enter ↩` to create a new tag.

Once the tag is created, click on the "Create Link" button to assign the tag to the link.

## How to edit or delete a Tag

Tags can be edited via the Tags filter section on the left sidebar.

Simply hover over a tag filter and a `⋮` icon will appear. Click on the icon to open the edit dropdown menu for the given tag.
