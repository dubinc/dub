Bitly is a popular URL shortener that lets you create short links, which can be used in your marketing campaigns, social media posts, and more.

## How to migrate from Bitly to Dub

If you're looking to migrate from Bitly to Dub, we've built a custom migration tool that will help you migrate your links in just 2-3 clicks.

## Step 1: Sign in with Bitly

If you haven't already, [create a project on Dub](what-is-a-project#how-to-create-a-project).

<Note variant="info">
  **Protip**: Once you create your project, we generally recommend you **_not to
  [configure your domain](how-to-add-custom-domain)_** until you've migrated all
  your links. This will prevent any potential downtime for your links.
</Note>

Then, from your project dashboard, click on the `⌄` button next to the **Create Link** button and select **Import from Bitly**.

This will open a modal that prompts you to sign in with Bitly.

Behind the scenes, we'll fetch all your Bitly groups and their respective custom domains and number of tags. You'll be presented with a list of groups that we've found.

<Note variant="info">
  If you accidentally signed in to the wrong Bitly account, you can click on the
  **Sign in with a different account?** link to sign in with a different Bitly
  account.
</Note>

Select the domains you want to migrate and choose if you'd like to import their respective tags as well. You can learn more about [how tags work on Dub](how-to-use-tags).

Once you're done, click **Confirm import**. In just a few seconds, all your links will be migrated to Dub.

Once all your links have been imported, we will send you an email to let you know that the migration is complete.
