### Recommended Versions

| Package | Version  |
| ------- | -------- |
| node    | v23.11.0 |
| pnpm    | 9.15.9   |

### Common Local Development Issues

- `The table <table-name> does not exist in the current database.` - Run `pnpm prisma:push` push the state of the Prisma schema file to the database without using migrations files.
- The project is not building correctly locally - verify your versions of `node` and `pnpm` match the recommended versions above. Delete all `node_modules`, `.next`, and `.turbo` directories in the `apps` and `packages` directory. You may now reinstall `node_modules` by running `pnpm install` and attempt to rebuild the project with `pnpm build`.

## License

Dub Technologies, Inc. is a commercial open-source company, which means some parts of this open-source repository require a commercial license. The concept is called "Open Core" where the core technology (99%) is fully open source, licensed under [AGPLv3](https://opensource.org/license/agpl-v3) and the last 1% is covered under a commercial license (["/ee" Enterprise Edition](<https://github.com/dubinc/dub/tree/ee/apps/web/app/(ee)>)) which we believe is entirely relevant for larger organisations that require enterprise features. Enterprise features are built by the core engineering team of Dub Technologies, Inc., which is hired full-time.
