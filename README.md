## License

Dub Technologies, Inc. is a commercial open-source company, which means some parts of this open-source repository require a commercial license. The concept is called "Open Core" where the core technology (99%) is fully open source, licensed under [AGPLv3](https://opensource.org/license/agpl-v3) and the last 1% is covered under a commercial license (["/ee" Enterprise Edition](<https://github.com/dubinc/dub/tree/ee/apps/web/app/(ee)>)) which we believe is entirely relevant for larger organisations that require enterprise features. Enterprise features are built by the core engineering team of Dub Technologies, Inc., which is hired full-time.
