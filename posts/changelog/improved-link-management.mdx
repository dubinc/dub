Today, we are introducing a range of improvements to our link management offering:

1. **Archiving links**: You can now archive your links with the click of a button. Archived links will still work & accrue stats, but will be hidden on your dashboard by default.

2. **Show my links only**: You can now filter your project links with the "Show my links only" filter, which will hide all links created by other users in your organization, and only show links that you created.

3. **Allow '/' in custom shortlinks**<sup>1</sup>: You can now use '/' in your custom shortlinks. This is useful for adding structure to your shortlinks, e.g. `doma.in/r/abc`. Huge shoutout to [Alex Bass](https://twitter.com/alexhbass) from [Efficient](https://efficient.app/) for this feature request!

<sup>1</sup> This feature is only available for shortlinks with a custom domain,
not `dub.sh` links.
